EDA, jak sama nazwa wskazuje, to dogłębna analiza naszych danych. Proces EDA przeplata czyszczenie danych, radzenie sobie z brakującymi wartościami oraz wizualizację danych i ich właściwości statystycznych. Zazwyczaj wszystkie te procesy są wykonywane razem, ale dla potrzeb edukacyjnych rozbijemy je na osobne części.\n","\n","### Prerequisites\n","[flights.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cVV3TZcxS31fk9JrskaRP1pbOfaoNcwe/view?usp=sharing)\n","(źródło: https://www.kaggle.com/mmetter/flights/data).\n","W większości przypadków dane posiadają dokumentację. **Czytanie dokumentacji danych jest ważne**!!!!

Analizując każdy z nich z osobna, widzimy, że dane w pierwszym wierszu najprawdopodobniej zawierały niepoprawną wartość `pg_loan` (97 000 GBP w przypadku pożyczki podyplomowej). W drugim, z jakiegoś powodu wartość `total_loan` nie została obliczona. Naiwną strategią może być nadpisanie całkowitych kwot pożyczki sumą `ug_loan` i `pg_loan`. To naprawia typy błędów, w których zwracany jest drugi wiersz. Jednak może istnieć podstawowy problem z powodu pierwszego rzędu. Jeśli zsumujemy tutaj `ug_loan` i `pg_loan`, utworzymy **obserwację odstającą**. W prawdziwym zbiorze danych mogą wystąpić bardzo realne zagrożenia, takie jak te, które mogą narazić na szwank integralność danych – takie problemy mogą łatwo wymykać się spod kontroli, więc upewnij się, że poświęcisz czas na przemyślenie, w jaki sposób Twoje działania wpłyną na Twój dane.\n","\n","Jak wspomniano wcześniej, niektóre aspekty nauki o danych są sztuką – ale jakąkolwiek decyzję heurystyczną podejmiemy, musimy znaleźć dla niej mocne uzasadnienie. W tym konkretnym przypadku zamierzam usunąć wiersze z niepoprawnym `total_loan`, ponieważ ten błąd prawdopodobnie wystąpił z powodu błędu we wprowadzaniu danych przez człowieka. Wiersze z `total_loan = 0` prawdopodobnie wystąpiły z powodu jakiegoś systematycznego błędu - być może z innej bazy danych, w której nie podano sumy total_loan. Biorąc pod uwagę inne weryfikacje, jednym z rozwiązań, które moglibyśmy wybrać, jest zsumowanie dwóch kolumn."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":241},"id":"3LYmqAwZLYsG","outputId":"9a6b528d-bb4a-4e49-ed58-afbf2b87098c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["    name        dob  age deceased  ug_loan  pg_loan  total_loan\n","2  Debee 1970-11-19   51        F    32400    97000       42100\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-40cee97e-1f5b-4400-baf5-4d150c1bc4fb\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>name</th>\n","      <th>dob</th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>deceased</th>\n","      <th>ug_loan</th>\n","      <th>pg_loan</th>\n","      <th>total_loan</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Idaline</td>\n","      <td>1971-04-27</td>\n","      <td>50</td>\n","      <td>F</td>\n","      <td>24100</td>\n","      <td>11900</td>\n","      <td>36000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Freddie</td>\n","      <td>1962-12-27</td>\n","      <td>59</td>\n","      <td>F</td>\n","      <td>26600</td>\n","      <td>12600</td>\n","      <td>39200</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Joyann</td>\n","      <td>1957-01-24</td>\n","      <td>41</td>\n","      <td>T</td>\n","      <td>24400</td>\n","      <td>11500</td>\n","      <td>35900</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Ajay</td>\n","      <td>1960-05-12</td>\n","      <td>61</td>\n","      <td>F</td>\n","      <td>25500</td>\n","      <td>18800</td>\n","      <td>44300</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>Emelia</td>\n","      <td>1957-11-23</td>\n","      <td>57</td>\n","      <td>T</td>\n","      <td>34000</td>\n","      <td>17500</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-40cee97e-1f5b-4400-baf5-4d150c1bc4fb')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-40cee97e-1f5b-4400-baf5-4d150c1bc4fb button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Nie będziemy tutaj przyglądać się wyrażeniu regularnemu, ale ważne jest, aby wiedzieć o jego mocy. Zasadniczo wyrażenie regularne pozwala nam określić reguły dla ciągów, które chcemy dopasować. Ma bardzo szerokie zastosowanie. Oto kilka przykładów:\n","- identyfikuj wiadomości e-mail w zakresach tekstu\n","- sprawdź, czy adres URL ma poprawny format\n","- wyodrębnij tylko cyfry z ciągu tekstowego\n","\n","Kiedy natkniesz się na zadania, które wymagają oczyszczenia danych tekstowych, regex jest narzędziem do tego zadania."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8ZPP2j-VLYsT"},"source":["## Scalanie danych razem (merging)\n","\n","Czasami znajdziemy dane w różnych plikach, które musimy połączyć w jedną ramkę danych, zanim będziemy mogli jej użyć.
